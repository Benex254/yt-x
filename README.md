```

# Dependencies

**Required:**

- jq - to pass the json data
- curl - to download preview images
- yt-dlp - to provide the data
- fzf - for the main ui
- mpv - for streaming
- ffmpeg - to properly download hsl streams

**optional:**

- gum - for an even better ui
- chafa - image rendering
- icat - image rendering
- imgcat - image rendering

# Usage

```bash
# launch the ui
yt-x

# edit your config
yt-x -e
```

## TIPS

To enable imports of subscriptions and viewing of private playlists and videos
set your preferred browser in your config file

For Example:
```ini
PREFERRED_BROWSER: chrome
```

To enable mpv to directly access private playlists and videos
add something like this in your mpv.conf

```ini
ytdl-raw-options=cookies-from-browser=chrome

# You can also set the quality
ytdl-format="best[height<=1080]/bestvideo[height<=1080]+bestaudio/best"
```

## Define Custom Playlists

This option lets you define custom playlists.
Its a list of playlist objects.
located: `~/.config/yt-x/custom_playlists.json`

For example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "<name of the playlist, should only contain letters or numbers>",
    "playlistUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=<playlist-id>",
    "playlistWatchUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=<playlist-id>"
  }
]
```
